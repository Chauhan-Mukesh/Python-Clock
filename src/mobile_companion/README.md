# Mobile Companion App Examples

This directory contains examples for building mobile companion apps that interact with the Enhanced Python Digital Clock.

## API Endpoints

The clock provides a RESTful HTTP API when the mobile companion server is running (default port 8888).

### GET Endpoints

- `GET /status` - Get clock application status
- `GET /time` - Get current time and date
- `GET /weather` - Get current weather data
- `GET /calendar` - Get upcoming calendar events
- `GET /alarms` - Get all configured alarms

### POST Endpoints

- `POST /alarm` - Add a new alarm
- `POST /settings` - Update clock settings

## Getting Started

1. Start the Enhanced Python Digital Clock application
2. Go to Tools â†’ Mobile Companion
3. Click "Start Server" (default port 8888)
4. Use the API endpoints from your mobile app
5. Replace `localhost` with your computer's IP address when accessing from mobile devices

## Security Note

The API currently runs without authentication for simplicity. In production environments, consider adding:
- API key authentication
- HTTPS encryption
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
